diff - u useful for finding differences in a file
Saves time over looking manually for differences

Having access to older versions of your code helps when a change causes something to break and you 
have to go back to fix it.

Save when you choose to save a version of the file.

Commits are the basic building blocks of Git.


git diff  commit_id1  commit_id2   compares two versions of a file

git diff --stat   gives some statistics about the changes made in the commit


The commit ID of the most recent commit is 3884eab839af1e82c44267484cf2945a766081f3. 
You can use this commit ID to return to the latest commit after checking out an older commit.
